        <h2>What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?</h2>
        <p class="post-meta">Published on: <strong>5 November 2025</strong> • By Leslie Amadi</p>

        <p>
            Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security process where users provide two different types of verification 
            to prove their identity. It adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts, ensuring that even if someone 
            knows your password, they still cannot log in without the second factor.
        </p>

        <h3>🔐 Why is 2FA Important?</h3>
        <p>
            Passwords alone are no longer enough. Cyber attackers often steal or guess credentials through phishing, 
            data leaks, or weak password practices. 2FA reduces this risk by requiring:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Something you know:</strong> Password or PIN</li>
            <li><strong>Something you have:</strong> Phone, authenticator app, or email code</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🛠 Types of 2FA Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Email or SMS codes</li>
            <li>Authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy)</li>
            <li>Hardware security keys (YubiKey)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>✅ Real-World Example</h3>
        <p>
            When you log into your Gmail account, you enter your password. Google then sends a code to your phone. 
            You must enter that code to complete the login — that's 2FA in action.
        </p>

        <h3>📌 Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
            Enabling 2FA is one of the simplest but most effective ways to secure your online accounts. 
            As a technical writer, understanding and explaining this process clearly is crucial for user help guides, 
            onboarding documentation, and security best practices.
