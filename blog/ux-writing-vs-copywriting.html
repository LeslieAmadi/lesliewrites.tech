        <h1>UX Writing vs Copywriting — What’s the Difference?</h1>
        <p class="post-meta">Published on January 2025 · UX Writing</p>

        <p>Copywriters sell. UX writers help users succeed.</p>

        <p>Both professions use words, but they live in different parts of a product’s journey. Copywriters work in marketing—homepages, ads, landing pages, email campaigns. Their goal? Persuade people to care, click, or buy.</p>

        <p>UX writers, on the other hand, write for the product itself—buttons, error messages, app screens, empty states. Their goal? Help people complete tasks smoothly and confidently.</p>

        <h2>🔹 Key Differences at a Glance</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Copywriting</th>
                <th>UX Writing</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Persuades and sells</td>
                <td>Guides and supports</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Used in ads, emails, landing pages</td>
                <td>Used in apps, dashboards, forms, settings</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Emotion-driven</td>
                <td>Clarity and function-driven</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Measures success by clicks or sales</td>
                <td>Measures success by task completion and usability</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>🔹 Example</h2>
        <p><strong>Copywriting:</strong> “Join 10,000+ creators boosting productivity with our toolkit!”</p>
        <p><strong>UX Writing:</strong> Button simply says: “Create account”</p>

        <h2>🔹 When They Work Together</h2>
        <p>Great products use both. Copywriting brings users in. UX writing keeps them there. For example, a landing page convinces someone to download an app. Once inside, UX writing guides them through sign-up, settings, and actions.</p>

        <h2>✅ Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>If copywriting attracts, UX writing retains. If copywriting is the invitation, UX writing is the experience.</p>
