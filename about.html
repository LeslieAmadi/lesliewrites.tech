  <!-- ABOUT ME -->

      <h1>About Me 🌸</h1>

      <p>
        Hello, I’m Leslie a technical writer working in the IT industry. I enjoy documenting complex systems because it 
        allows me to understand products from both the engineering and user perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can probably tell a lot about me just from the way this site looks. I’m playful but professional, 
        and I wanted my website to express that balance. It reflects the fun, bubbly, dreamy and romantic side of who I am, 
        while still staying grounded in thoughtful, well-structured work.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m especially interested in responsible AI, full-stack systems, and clear system design. 
        My focus is on turning complexity into calm, structured documentation that supports confident decisions and safe technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        My journey has shaped how I work. Born in Nigeria, I moved to Hungary at 15, later lived in Ukraine, and relocated to Germany during the war.
         Today, I’m building a stable life here learning German, learning to drive, making new friends, and growing into the next chapter of my career.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work, I enjoy learning new subjects, ice skating, cooking seafood from different cultures, reading, writing, and listening to podcasts.
         On weekends, I often spend time catching up with my siblings and my mum back home staying grounded in where I come from while building where I’m going.
      </p>
