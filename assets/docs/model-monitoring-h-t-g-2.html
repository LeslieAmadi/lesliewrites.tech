  <h2>Objective</h2>

  <p>
    This guide shows how to implement model monitoring as a continuous operational capability —
    not as a one-time configuration task.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal is not simply visibility.  
    The goal is reliability, accountability, and long-term system stability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Monitoring transforms a model from a deployed artefact into a governed system.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="foundations">
  <h2>Establishing Monitoring Foundations</h2>

  <p>
    Before instrumentation, the system must have a baseline of meaning.
  </p>

  <p>
    We begin by defining what “normal” looks like.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Define baseline performance metrics</li>
    <li>Establish acceptable variance ranges</li>
    <li>Identify critical model behaviours</li>
    <li>Map model outputs to business risk</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This creates the reference frame against which change becomes visible.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="execution">
  <h2>Execution Path</h2>

  <p>
    We now instrument the system so behaviour becomes observable.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Enable inference logging</strong>  
      Capture inputs, outputs, and prediction metadata.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Configure drift detection</strong>  
      Monitor changes in data distribution and model response patterns.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Define alert thresholds</strong>  
      Establish boundaries where human review is triggered.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Connect monitoring to response</strong>  
      Ensure alerts map to real operational actions.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Integrate observability tooling</strong>  
      Centralise logs, metrics, and model health signals.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    At this point, the system becomes observable, not just operational.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="governance">
  <h2>Creating the Governance Loop</h2>

  <p>
    Monitoring without response is noise.
  </p>

  <p>
    A monitoring system only becomes meaningful when it feeds governance.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Establish regular review cadences</li>
    <li>Define ownership of model health</li>
    <li>Formalise escalation paths</li>
    <li>Document intervention procedures</li>
    <li>Version monitoring policies</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This closes the loop:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Observation → Interpretation → Decision → Action → Review</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    At this stage, the model is no longer just monitored.  
    It is governed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Reliability becomes a system property, not a hope.
