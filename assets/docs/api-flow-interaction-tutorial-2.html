  <h2>The Goal</h2>

  <p>
    In this lesson, we will experience how an API becomes a living system of communication.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will send structured input, receive structured output, and observe how meaning
    emerges through interaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not about learning endpoints.
    It is about learning flow.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the end of the lesson, you will have a felt sense of how systems speak,
    listen, respond, and create shared understanding.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="step1">
  <h2>Step 1 — Sending a Request</h2>

  <p>
    We begin by sending a structured request to the system.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is the moment where human intention becomes machine-readable structure.
  </p>

  <pre>
POST /risk-score
{
  "age": 60,
  "bmi": 31,
  "bp": 150
}
  </pre>

  <p>
    Notice what is happening here.
  </p>

  <p>
    Human information is being translated into a formal language the system can understand.
  </p>

  <p>
    This translation is the first act of communication.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="step2">
  <h2>Step 2 — Observing the Response</h2>

  <p>
    The system responds.
  </p>

  <p>
    A signal returns.
  </p>

  <pre>
{ "risk": 0.74 }
  </pre>

  <p>
    Pause here.
  </p>

  <p>
    A complex internal process has been compressed into a single, simple output.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is what APIs do:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>They hide complexity</li>
    <li>They expose meaning</li>
    <li>They translate systems into signals</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Structure has become information.
    Information has become meaning.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="step3">
  <h2>Step 3 — Adding Context</h2>

  <p>
    Now we ask the system to explain itself.
  </p>

  <pre>
GET /risk-score/explain
  </pre>

  <pre>
BMI: 43%
BP: 39%
Age: 18%
  </pre>

  <p>
    Notice the shift.
  </p>

  <p>
    The system is no longer just responding —
    it is communicating.
  </p>

  <p>
    We move from output to understanding.
  </p>

  <p>
    The system becomes interpretable, not just operational.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="repeat">
  <h2>Repeat the Experience</h2>

  <p>
    Change one value.
  </p>

  <p>
    Send the request again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Observe the response.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ask for explanation again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Watch how the system shifts.
  </p>

  <p>
    This repetition is not mechanical.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is how intuition forms.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through repetition, you begin to feel:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>How structure shapes outcomes</li>
    <li>How systems respond to change</li>
    <li>How communication emerges from interaction</li>
    <li>How meaning forms through flow</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is the beginning of system literacy.
