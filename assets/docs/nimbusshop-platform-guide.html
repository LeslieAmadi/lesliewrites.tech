        <h3>Device Activation</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Register Device</strong> button redirects the administrator back to the device page, where the
          activation steps are highlighted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clicking <strong>Activate This Device</strong> enables gameplay on the target machine and resets the current
          session for the logged-in administrator.
        </p>

        <h4>Steps for Device Activation</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Navigate to the physical device that needs activation.</li>

          <li>Click <strong>Activate This Device</strong>.</li>
          <li>An alert is displayed confirming the device was successfully activated and registered.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Device Details</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Device:</strong> e.g. <code>Building (N0)</code> — name and number assigned by the Shop Admin.</li>

          <li><strong>Last Activity:</strong> Timestamp of the device’s last activity.</li>
          <li><strong>Wallets:</strong> Current device balance.</li>
          <li><strong>Edit:</strong> Allows the Admin to modify device details.</li>
          <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Allows removal of device registration (subject to permissions).</li>

      <!-- DASHBOARD FUNCTIONALITIES -->
      <section>
        <h2>Dashboard Functionalities</h2>

        <h3>Shop Statistics (Stats Widget)</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Stats</strong> widget displays real-time shop-level operational data, including:

          These metrics provide administrators with at-a-glance operational status for monitoring shop activity and
          financial health.
        </p>

        <h3>Quick Links Panel</h3>
        <p>The Quick Links panel provides shortcuts to frequently used functions:</p>

          <li>
            <strong>Register New Device:</strong> Opens the device registration form with required fields like Device ID,
            Shop Assignment, Activation Status. The system validates the device ID before registration.

            <strong>View Detailed Reports:</strong> Redirects to the Location dashboard, where admins can access
            transaction logs, GGR, deposits, withdrawals, and round history per device and shop. Reports support time,
            shop, and device filters and can be exported.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Device Money Transfer Module</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Device Money Transfer</strong> feature enables administrators to execute financial operations at
          the device level.
        </p>

        <h4>Functional Inputs</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Transaction Type:</strong>
            <ul>

          <li>
            <strong>Process Transfer:</strong> Executes the deposit or withdrawal. The system validates transaction
            limits, device status, and balances, then updates the wallet in real time. On validation failure, an error
            message is displayed and logged for audit.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Devices Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The device overview presents a summarised view of each device, including activation status, locked status, and
          GGR. This allows administrators to quickly identify underperforming or inactive devices.

        <h3>Step-by-Step: Player → Wallet → Gameplay → Withdrawal → Reporting</h3>

        <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Shop Admin account exists and is logged in.</li>
          <li>Target device is registered and active in NimbusShop.</li>
          <li>Cash float is available at the shop for deposits/withdrawals.</li>
          <li>Network connectivity and NimbusShop services are operational.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>1. Player Arrives</h4>
        <p>
          Player approaches the shop and requests to play. Staff greet the player and confirm any ID requirements based
          on shop policy.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Admin Registers Wallet</h4>
        <p>
          Admin navigates to <strong>Players / Wallets → Create New Player / Register Wallet</strong>.
          The system creates a player profile and electronic wallet with a unique ID.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Player Deposits Cash</h4>
        <p>
          Admin goes to the player profile, selects <strong>Wallet &gt; Deposit</strong>, enters amount,
          and confirms cash receipt. The system records the deposit and queues it for immediate processing.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Wallet Updated</h4>
        <p>
          Wallet balance is updated in real time; transaction ID is generated and logged. Player can see the new balance
          on the device.
        </p>

        <h4>5. Player Plays on Device</h4>
        <p>
          Player selects a game using device credits. The device debits the wallet for each round, and the session is
          tracked in NimbusShop.
        </p>

        <h4>6. Balance Displayed in Real Time</h4>
        <p>
          After each round, the balance is updated on both the device UI and the admin dashboards. Transaction logs
          capture debits and credits per round.
        </p>

        <h4>7. Break Taken → Device Locked</h4>
        <p>
          Player or Admin chooses <strong>Lock Device</strong>. The system pauses gameplay, hides balance, and logs a lock event.
        </p>

        <h4>8. Device Unlocked</h4>
        <p>
          Player unlocks with a PIN, or Admin unlocks via the dashboard. The system verifies identity and resumes session
          where appropriate.
        </p>

        <h4>9. Player Requests Withdrawal</h4>
        <p>
          Player requests a withdrawal; Admin reviews balance and pending holds in the wallet view and prepares to process.
        </p>

        <h4>10. Admin Processes Withdrawal</h4>
        <p>
          Admin selects <strong>Wallet &gt; Withdraw</strong>, enters amount, and confirms payout. System deducts funds,
          logs the transaction, and the player receives cash.
        </p>

        <h4>11. Wallet Updated (Post-Withdrawal)</h4>
        <p>
          Balance is updated, and an audit trail (operator ID, time, device, shop) is persisted for compliance.
        </p>

        <h4>12. Admin Runs End-of-Day Reports</h4>
        <p>
          Admin generates a daily report summarising deposits, withdrawals, GGR, and device activity. Totals are
          reconciled against physical cash.
        </p>
