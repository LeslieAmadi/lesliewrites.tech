# Neural Networks

## Overview
A **Neural Network** is a type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain.  
It consists of layers of interconnected nodes, or *neurons*, that learn to recognise complex patterns in data.  

Neural Networks form the foundation of modern **Deep Learning**, powering everything from voice recognition to image classification.

## Key Concepts
- **Neuron:** The basic unit that receives input, applies a transformation, and passes the result forward.  
- **Layers:** Organised groups of neurons — including input, hidden, and output layers.  
- **Weights and Biases:** Parameters adjusted during training to minimise prediction errors.  
- **Activation Function:** Determines whether a neuron “fires” (common examples include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh).  
- **Loss Function:** Measures how far off the network’s predictions are from the actual results.

## Visual Summary
Input Layer → Hidden Layer(s) → Output Layer
Each layer transforms data and passes it forward.  
The network “learns” by adjusting its internal connections until outputs match the desired results.

## Real-World Applications
- 🧠 **Facial Recognition:** Apple’s Face ID or Meta’s photo tagging.  
- 🎙️ **Voice Assistants:** Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant.  
- 📧 **Spam Detection:** Filtering emails in Gmail.  
- 💳 **Fraud Detection:** Identifying unusual financial transactions.  
- 📷 **Image Recognition:** Detecting objects in photos or videos.

## Example
In a simple neural network predicting loan approval:

Inputs: [Income, Age, Credit Score]
→ Hidden Layers: Detect relationships
→ Output: Approve / Deny


The model adjusts internal weights each time it predicts incorrectly until it learns the right decision pattern.

## Why It Matters
Neural Networks are incredibly flexible — they can learn from almost any type of data: text, sound, or images.  
They enable many of the intelligent systems that define the modern world, making them essential for any AI-driven organisation.
