# AI Ethics & Bias — Explained Simply  
*By Leslie Amadi | Last updated: November 2025*

## 📌 Introduction

AI is powerful, but it isn’t always fair. Behind every system — whether it’s used for hiring, insurance, or policing — are decisions made by humans. These systems can accidentally learn *bias* from the data they are trained on.

## 🤖 What Is AI Bias?

AI bias happens when an AI system gives unfair results that favour or harm a certain group of people.

### **Example**
- A hiring AI rejects CVs with African-sounding names more often.
- A facial recognition system is less accurate for darker skin tones.

### **Why does this happen?**
✅ The AI was trained on unbalanced data  
✅ Most of the training examples came from one gender, race, or region  
✅ No human expert reviewed or corrected it

## ⚖️ What Is AI Ethics?

AI ethics is about making sure AI is used **responsibly, fairly, and transparently**.

### **Important Principles**

| Transparency       | People should know how decisions are made |
| Accountability     | Someone must be responsible for mistakes |
| Privacy            | AI must protect user data |
