<section id="overview">
  <h2>Platform Overview</h2>

  <p>
    This API Hub provides a structured entry point into the platform’s services,
    documentation, and operational model.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is designed not as a list of endpoints, but as a navigable system —
    enabling developers, engineers, and stakeholders to understand not only
    how the platform works, but how it is governed, trusted, and evolved.
  </p>

  <p>
    The hub functions as the system’s orientation layer.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="architecture">
  <h2>Platform Architecture</h2>

  <p>
    The platform is organised as a layered system:
  </p>

  <pre>
Client Applications
        ↓
API Gateway Layer
        ↓
Security & Identity Services
        ↓
ML Service Layer
        ↓
Explainability & Trust Layer
        ↓
Monitoring & Governance Layer
  </pre>

  <p>
    Each layer is independently documented, governed, and evolved.
  </p>

  <p>
    This structure ensures separation of concerns, operational stability,
    and long-term platform scalability.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="services">
  <h2>Core Platform Services</h2>

  <p>
    The platform exposes a set of core services that function together
    as a cohesive system.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Risk Scoring API</strong><br/>
      Predictive evaluation service providing normalised risk outputs.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Explainability API</strong><br/>
      Interpretability service exposing model reasoning and influence factors.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Monitoring Services</strong><br/>
      Observability and model health infrastructure.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Security Services</strong><br/>
      Authentication, access control, and identity management.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These services are designed as interoperable platform components,
    not standalone endpoints.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="learning">
  <h2>Learning & Onboarding Paths</h2>

  <p>
    The documentation system is structured to support multiple learning journeys:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Conceptual Understanding</strong><br/>
      Explanation pages that build system comprehension.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Guided Learning</strong><br/>
      Tutorials that develop practical system intuition.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Operational Execution</strong><br/>
      How-To guides that support task completion.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>System Reference</strong><br/>
      API contracts and technical specifications.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This structure enables different user roles to navigate the platform
    according to their needs and responsibilities.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="governance">
  <h2>Platform Governance Model</h2>

  <p>
    Governance is embedded into the platform architecture.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is not an external process — it is a system property.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Versioned service contracts</li>
    <li>Access control policies</li>
    <li>Audit logging</li>
    <li>Model governance workflows</li>
    <li>Monitoring and escalation paths</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This ensures that platform evolution remains controlled, transparent,
    and aligned with organisational responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    The API Hub acts as the coordination layer between technology,
    governance, and human decision-making.
