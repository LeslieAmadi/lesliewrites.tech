# AI Documentation Style Guide
### by Leslie Amadi

## 1. Purpose
This guide defines the tone, terminology, and ethical standards for creating AI-related documentation for products, research, or case studies under the Leslie Writes brand.

---

## 2. Voice and Tone
- **Voice:** Confident, knowledgeable, and empathetic.  
- **Tone:** Professional, conversational, and inclusive.  
- **Goal:** Make complex AI concepts approachable to non-technical readers.

**Examples:**
✅ “The AI model analyses text to predict likely responses.”  
🚫 “The AI bot uses a sophisticated NLP framework to extrapolate linguistic probabilities.”

---

## 3. Formatting and Grammar
- Use **UK English** spelling (colour, behaviour, modelled).
- Write in **active voice**: “The model generates output,” not “Output is generated.”
- Use **sentence case** for headings and UI labels.
- Avoid jargon; explain acronyms on first use (e.g., *Transformer (AI model type)*).

---

## 4. Ethical Writing Guidelines
1. Always disclose when AI-generated content is used.  
2. Avoid biased, gendered, or culturally insensitive examples.  
3. Don’t imply the AI has emotions, opinions, or intent.  
4. Emphasise human oversight — AI assists, it doesn’t replace.  
5. Include dataset transparency: cite data sources or model provenance.

---

## 5. Accessibility
- Use clear alt text for images and diagrams.  
- Structure content logically with headings.  
- Keep sentences under 25 words on average.  
- Avoid colour-only cues; include icons or labels where possible.
