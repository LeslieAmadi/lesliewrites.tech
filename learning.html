      <h1>What I’m Learning Right Now</h1>
      <p>
        This page is a living record of what I’m currently exploring, practising, and thinking about.
        I keep it here as a way of staying honest about my growth and connected to the systems I document.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t see learning as something separate from my work.
        Every concept I study and every tool I practise with shapes how I approach technical writing
        especially when working with complex systems, data, and emerging technologies.

          <div class="strip-title">System Thinking in AI</div>
          <p>
            I’ve been focusing on understanding how AI systems behave end-to-end
            from data inputs and model evaluation to deployment, monitoring, and documentation for responsible use.

          <p>
            Strengthening my programming skills by working across both front-end and back-end concepts,
            with a focus on how applications are structured, how data flows through systems, and how documentation fits into real development workflows.

            Exploring how structure, hierarchy, and language choices affect how people understand systems —
            not just what the system does, but how safely and confidently it can be used.

            Learning how applications are built across the stack — from user interfaces to server logic and data layers —

          <div class="strip-title">Documenting an AI Workflow</div>
          <p>
            I recently mapped out a fictional AI classification system end-to-end:
            data sources, preprocessing steps, model behaviour, evaluation metrics, and operational constraints.
            The goal was not just to describe the system, but to make its risks, assumptions, and limitations visible.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="strip-card">
          <div class="strip-title">Full-Stack Feature Walkthrough</div>
          <p>
            I’ve been building and documenting a small full-stack feature
            tracing how user actions on the interface connect to backend logic and data handling.
            Writing the documentation alongside the code helped me understand where developers actually need clarity.

        <div class="strip-card">
          <div class="strip-title">Operational Process Design</div>
          <p>
            I created a workflow document for a simulated incident-response process,
            focusing on clarity under pressure: what happens, who is responsible, and what decisions need to be documented for accountability.

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Why I Keep This Page</h2>

      <p>
        I keep this page as a reminder that good documentation grows out of curiosity, practice, and real systems.
        It helps me stay grounded in the work itself not just the output.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether I’m studying AI governance, writing about infrastructure, or learning how full-stack applications are built,
        my goal remains the same: to create documentation that is technically accurate, human-centred,
        and genuinely useful for the people who rely on it.
